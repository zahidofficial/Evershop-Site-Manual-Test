Q3|[Mark 20] Let's say, your development team implemented the feature on the  Evershop site (https://demo.evershop.io/). Now execute your test case into the URL and generate a report.

Q4|[Mark 40] Now there is a happy path journey for searching with the text “Nike react phantom run flyknit 2”. Add a couple of small-sized black products to your cart. Then verify the Cart.
